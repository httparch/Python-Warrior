An enemy has appeared before you!<br>
In order to reach the exit, you have to fight him! (Don't worry, you are stronger than him)<br>
To attack, you must call the <code>Player.attack();</code> function<br>
You can find out what is in front of you with the <code>Player.getNext();</code> function. (returns "e" if enemy)<br>
If you haven't written much javascript code yet, here's a little help about branching:<br>
<code>if(function() == "something"){ (...); }
else { (...); }</code>
